  <dt>Set up</dt>
  <dd>- Checkers is played by two players. Each player begins the game with 12 colored discs. (Typically, one set of pieces is red and the other white.)</dd>
  <dd>- The board consists of 64 squares, alternating between 32 dark and 32 light squares. It is positioned so that each player has a light square on the right side corner closest to him or her.</dd>
  <dd>- Each player places his or her pieces on the 12 dark squares closest to him or her.</dd>
  <dt>Move/Jump Play</dt>
  <dd>- Red moves first. Players then alternate moves.</dd>
  <dd>- Moves are allowed only on the dark squares, so pieces always move diagonally. Single pieces are always limited to forward moves (toward the opponent).</dd>
  <dd>- A piece making a non-capturing move (not involving a jump) may move only one square.</dd>
  <dd>- A piece making a capturing move (a jump) leaps over one of the opponent's pieces, landing in a straight diagonal line on the other side. Only one piece may be captured in a single jump; however<strike>, multiple jumps are allowed on a single turn</strike>.</dd>
  <dd>- When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.</dd>
  <dd>- If a player is able to make a capture, there is no option -- the jump must be made. <strike>If more than one capture is available, the player is free to choose whichever he or she prefers.</strike></dd>
  <dd>- When a piece reaches the furthest row from the player who controls that piece, it is crowned and becomes a king. One of the pieces which had been captured is placed on top of the king so that it is twice as high as a single piece.</dd>
  <dd>- Kings are limited to moving diagonally, but may move both forward and backward. (Remember that single pieces, i.e. non-kings, are always limited to forward moves.)</dd>
  <dd><strike>Kings may combine jumps in several directions -- forward and backward -- on the same turn. Single pieces may shift direction diagonally during a multiple capture turn, but must always jump forward (toward the opponent).</strike></dd>
  <dt>Game End</dt>
  <dd>A player wins the game when the opponent cannot make a move. In most cases, this is because all of the opponent's pieces have been captured, but it could also be because all of his pieces are blocked in.</dd>
